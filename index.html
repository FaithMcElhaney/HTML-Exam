    <h1>The Evolution of the iPhone</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>The iPhone</li>
        <p>The first iPhone came out in 2007. It revolutionized the mobile phone as we know it. It had a megapixel camera, it was touch screen, and so much more. They sold 300,000 iPhones in the first weekend of sales. This was when Apple started to become one of the biggest brands in history.The first iPhone was just the beggining.</p>
        <li>iPhone 3 and 3Gs</li><p>This was the first iPhone after the drop of the original iPhone. Even though there was very little difference between the original and the 3, they sold a total of 1 million phones in the first weekend of sales. The only real difference between the original and the 3/3Gs is the video capability. People were still extremely shocked with the product and how different it was from the past devices that they had been using.
