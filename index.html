    <h1>The Evolution of the iPhone</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>The iPhone</li>
        <p>The first iPhone came out in 2007. It revolutionized the mobile phone as we know it. It had a megapixel camera, it was touch screen, and so much more. They sold 300,000 iPhones in the first weekend of sales. This was when Apple started to become one of the biggest brands in history.The first iPhone was just the beggining.</p>
        <li>iPhone 3 and 3Gs</li>
        <p>In 2008, this was the first iPhone after the drop of the original iPhone. Even though there was very little difference between the original and the 3, they sold a total of 1 million phones in the first weekend of sales. The only real difference between the original and the 3/3Gs is the video capability. People were still extremely shocked with the product and how different it was from the past devices that they had been using.

        </p>
        <li>iPhone 4</li>
        <p>The iPhone 4 once again changed the perspective of technology in 2010. Apple came out with a brand new shape for the phone. They had also worked on the front camera of the phone with retina display. If you don't know what retina display is, it's a term coined by Apple that basically means that the pixel density on a screen is so high that the naked eye physically cant distinguish individual pixels on the screen at a normal viewing distance. They also gave the phone a 3.5 inch display. The need for a iPhone was on the rise.

        </p>
        <li>iPhone 5</li>
        <p>In 2012, the iPhone 5 really hyped up the Apple industry. It had a brand new 4 inch display unlike the iPhone 3 which had a 3.5 inch screen. They had also geared up the amount of gigabytes of storage that could now be held on the phone. It now had 64 GB of storage. Also, they gave it a 8.0 mp camera. They also implemented the lightning connector for a faster charging experience. </p>
        <li>iPhone 11,11 Pro, and 11 Pro Max</li>
